Hello! Welcome to Prac 0 for COMP2160 Game Development.

We hope you've enjoyed this prac and that it has given you a good overview of your working environment as a game developer. Remember, although we use Github Desktop and Visual Studio Code in the lectures and practical examples, you are free to use whatever tools best suit you. The only real restriction is that you make your games in Unity (sorry Godot, Unreal and Pico-8 fans!). Please reach out to us if you have any questions or suggestions on how we can improve this introductory prac.
